# Codiff

Author a **narrative walkthrough** of the current change as a JSON document, then open
Codiff pointed at it. You — the agent running this skill — write the JSON yourself, because
you already hold the conversation that produced the change.

Codiff owns the format and the authoring guidance, so it stays current as Codiff updates.
This skill is just the handoff: fetch the guide, author the document, open Codiff.

## Workflow

1. **Get the current guidance from Codiff.** It explains the data model, how to think about
   the document, and prints the JSON schema:

   ```bash
   node scripts/open-codiff.mjs --guide
   ```

   Follow what it says. (Everything below is just the handoff around it.)

2. **Pick the change.** Default to the **staged** diff (`git diff --staged`). If the user named
   a target (a commit, `HEAD`, a PR, a path), use that. If nothing is staged, fall back to the
   working tree (`git diff`) and say so.

3. **Author the JSON** per the guide and write it to a **temporary file outside the
   repository** (so it never clutters the working tree). Pick a unique absolute path in the
   system temp directory — e.g. `/tmp/codiff-walkthrough-<id>.json` (use `$TMPDIR` on macOS).
   Remember that path for the next step.

4. **Open Codiff** with that file:

   ```bash
   node scripts/open-codiff.mjs --file /tmp/codiff-walkthrough-<id>.json /path/to/repository
   ```

   Forward an explicit target after the flag if the user gave one:

   ```bash
   node scripts/open-codiff.mjs --file /tmp/codiff-walkthrough-<id>.json HEAD /path/to/repository
   node scripts/open-codiff.mjs --file /tmp/codiff-walkthrough-<id>.json pr 123 /path/to/repository
   ```

   The launcher passes `CODEX_THREAD_ID` to Codiff so follow-up questions reuse this
   conversation. Codiff validates and repairs the document against the live diff, so anchors
   that drift are pinned to a real section rather than dropped.

Emit JSON only into the file. Do not summarize the conversation back to the user; the skill
is a handoff into Codiff.
