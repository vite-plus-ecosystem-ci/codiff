# Codiff

Codiff is a beautiful, minimal, local diff viewer for reviewing Git changes and committing them.

## Why Codiff

- **Fast Local Reviews:** Review and commit changes in any Git repository.
- **LLM Walkthroughs:** Run `codiff -w` to generate an optimized commit walkthrough.
- **Inline Review Comments:** Comment directly on Pull Requests or copy review comments as Markdown for follow-ups.

## Download

Install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask nkzw-tech/tap/codiff
```

Download the latest Codiff app from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/codiff/releases).

After installing the app, run `Codiff > Install Terminal Helper` to make the `codiff` command available in your shell.

## Command Line

```bash
codiff
```

Run it from any Git repository, or pass a path:

```bash
codiff /path/to/repository
```

Review a specific commit:

```bash
codiff a1b2c3d
```

Review the current branch against a target branch:

```bash
codiff main
```

Start with an LLM-generated narrative walkthrough:

```bash
codiff -w
codiff -w a1b2c3d
```

Show all available options:

```bash
codiff --help
```

Launching Codiff in multiple repositories opens a separate native window for each repository.

## Command Bar

Open the command bar with <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on macOS, or
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on other platforms. Type to filter commands, use
<kbd>Up</kbd>/<kbd>Down</kbd> to move through results, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run the selected
command, and press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close it.

The command bar includes actions for common review workflows:

- Focus File Filter
- Find in Diffs
- Show File Tree, Show History, and Show Walkthrough
- Copy Review Comments
- Copy Review Comments and Close
- Toggle Viewed for the currently selected file
- Toggle Diff Layout, with the target layout action shown as the hint
- Open the currently selected file in your editor
- Toggle Sidebar
- Reload Window

## Configuration

Codiff reads configuration from `~/.codiff/codiff.jsonc`. Open `Codiff > Open Config File...` to
create the file with defaults and open it in your editor. The file supports JSONC comments and
trailing commas, includes a JSON schema reference for editor completion, and is watched while Codiff
is running so changes apply to open windows.

Set `settings.showWhitespace` to `true` to show whitespace-only changes in diffs and file line
counts; when it is `false`, Codiff hides those changes from the working-tree review state.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nkzw-tech/codiff/main/src/config/codiff-config.schema.json",
  "settings": {
    "agentBackend": "codex",
    "claudeModel": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "codeFontFamily": "",
    "codeFontSize": 13,
    "copyCommentsOnClose": false,
    "diffStyle": "split",
    "editorCommand": "",
    "lastRepositoryPath": "",
    "openAIModel": "gpt-5.3-codex-spark",
    "showWhitespace": false,
    "theme": "system",
    "walkthroughPrompt": "",
    "wordWrap": false,
  },
  "keymap": {
    "commandBar": "Mod+Shift+p",
    "diffSearch": "Mod+f",
    "fileFilter": "Mod+p",
    "nextSearchMatch": "Enter",
    "openFile": "Mod+k",
    "prevSearchMatch": "Shift+Enter",
    "closeSearch": "Escape",
    "submitComment": "Mod+Enter",
    "discardComment": "Escape",
    "toggleSidebar": "Mod+b",
  },
}
```

Set `settings.editorCommand` to customize file opening. Use `{file}` for the selected file and
`{repo}` for the repository root, for example `"subl \"{repo}\" \"{file}\""`.

Choose `View > Diff > Split` or `View > Diff > Unified`, use Toggle Diff Layout in the command bar,
or set `settings.diffStyle` to `split` for side-by-side diffs or `unified` for unified diffs.
Choose `View > Diff > Word Wrap`, use Toggle Word Wrap in the command bar, or set
`settings.wordWrap` to `true` to wrap long diff lines.
Choose `View > Diff > Font Size`, use the code font size commands in the command bar, or use
<kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>+</kbd>, <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd>, and
<kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd> to change only diff and code rendering font size.
Set `settings.codeFontFamily` manually to an installed CSS font family name, for example
`"JetBrains Mono"` or `"SF Mono"`. Leave it empty to use Codiff's bundled mono stack.
Use `Mod` for <kbd>Cmd</kbd> on macOS and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> on other platforms. Shortcut strings can
combine `Mod`, `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Shift`, or `Meta` with a key, for example `Mod+Shift+p` or
`Alt+Enter`.

## Walkthroughs

Codiff uses a local agent CLI for walkthroughs and inline review assistance. It supports two
backends, selected with the `settings.agentBackend` config value (or the `--agent` flag for a
single launch) and the `Agent` application menu:

- `codex` (default) — the OpenAI Codex CLI, configured with `settings.openAIModel`.
- `claude` — the [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) CLI, configured with `settings.claudeModel`.

Install the backend you want and verify it is available before using `codiff -w`:

```bash
codex --version
claude --version
```

Codiff looks for the CLI on `PATH` and the usual install locations. It does not run your shell
startup files to discover them. If a CLI is installed somewhere else, launch Codiff with an
explicit path:

```bash
CODIFF_CODEX_PATH=/absolute/path/to/codex codiff -w
CODIFF_CLAUDE_PATH=/absolute/path/to/claude codiff --agent claude -w
```

Claude Code rides your existing `claude` login (subscription or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`); run `claude`
once and complete `/login` if you have not already.

Set `settings.walkthroughPrompt` to add custom instructions to generated walkthrough prompts. Use it
to request a specific language, tone, or level of detail while Codiff keeps its walkthrough guide,
hunk ids, review-order constraints, and JSON schema in place.

To drive Codiff from your agent, install its skills from the application menu (`Install Codex Skill`
or `Install Claude Code Skill`). Codiff updates keep the installed skill current. Invoke it from the
agent:

```text
$codiff       /codiff        # author a narrative walkthrough and open Codiff
```

`codiff` asks Codiff for the current authoring guide (`codiff --walkthrough-guide`), writes a
narrative walkthrough JSON to a temporary file, and opens Codiff on it with `--walkthrough-file`
plus the current session id. Because the guidance lives in Codiff, the installed skill stays a thin
shim while the walkthrough sees the original conversation context without a lossy summary handoff.
